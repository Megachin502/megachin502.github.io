  <h1>Events and Behaviour</h1>
</header>
<main id="main">





<p id="event">An <dfn>event</dfn> in HTML is triggered by certain things that the user does, or that happens in the browser. For example, the &ldquo;click&rdquo; event occurs when the user clicks on the element. In the example above, you can click on the paragraph and it triggers execution of some JavaScript logic.</p>

<p>There are several other events on elements and we will use some of then as the course goes on. For example, there are events &ldquo;mouseover&rdquo; (when the mouse cursor moves over an element, on a desktop computer), &ldquo;load&rdquo; (when the page has finished loading), &ldquo;touchstart&rdquo; (the user starts touching an element, on a mobile device), and &ldquo;change&rdquo; (the user changes the entry in a form element). We will introduce more event types as they are needed.</p>

<p>The value for the event property (<code class="html">say_hello()</code> in the example) is a piece of JavaScript code. It will usually be short and used to call longer pieces of logic written elsewhere. In this example, it calls the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function defined in the JavaScript file.</p>

<section id="jquery">
<h2>jQuery Events</h2>

<p>In the previous section, we saw the jQuery style of attaching functions to events:</p>
 
<blockquote id="code-event1">
<pre class="brush: js">jQuery(…).click(some_function)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>We will continue to work with the jQuery style: it keeps the behaviour stuff isolated in the JavaScript file where it belongs, instead of mixing it in the HTML. (There are also <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12627478">a few other reasons</a> it's better, but we won't discuss them here.)</p>
</section>

<section id="others">
<h2>Other Events</h2>

<p>There are several other events that we can access with jQuery.</p>

<p>For example, the <code class="js">.mouseenter</code> and <code class="js">.mouseleave</code>  functions can be used to call a function when the use moves their mouse cursor over/away from an element. A more complete example of using these:</p>

<blockquote id="code-event2">
<pre class="brush: js">mouse_arrived = function() {…}
mouse_left = function() {…}
setup = function() {
  jQuery('#hoverable').mouseenter(mouse_arrived)
  jQuery('#hoverable').mouseleave(mouse_left)
}
jQuery(document).ready(setup)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting that these events aren't very meaningful for a touch device (phone or tablet). You need to be a little bit careful and think about whether or not your users can actually <em>do</em> the things required to trigger important events.</p>

<p>There are even more event types than are accessible this way in jQuery. In fact, the functions we have seen like <code class="js">.click</code> and <code class="js">.mouseenter</code> are actually shortcuts for the <code class="js">.on</code> function. These two lines of code are exactly equivalent:</p>

<blockquote id="code-event3">
<pre class="brush: js">jQuery('p').click(handle_click)
jQuery('p').on('click', handle_click)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use <code class="js">.on</code> to connect some other event types like this:</p>

<blockquote id="code-event4">
<pre class="brush: js">jQuery(document).on('scroll', user_scrolled)
jQuery('p').on('touchstart', handle_touch)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You probably won't have to use this technique for this course, but it's worth remembering that there's more interaction potential out there.</p>
