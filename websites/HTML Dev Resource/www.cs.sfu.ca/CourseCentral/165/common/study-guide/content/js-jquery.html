<h2>Libraries in Programming</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a full-featured programming language all by itself, but there are many tasks that programmers creating JavaScript need to do a lot which are not in the &ldquo;core&rdquo; language that is built into web browsers.</p>

<p>Every programming language is like this: the language itself lets programmers solve problems, but as the language is used, it becomes clear that some tasks must be done often (at least by programmers creating certain kinds of programs: others might have different common problems).</p>

<p id="code-library">It would be inefficient for every programmer, or even each project/company to solve these problems separately. So, developers often publish their solutions to frequently-encountered problems in <dfn>code libraries</dfn> (or just <dfn>libraries</dfn>). These libraries can be used by other programmers so they don't have to re-solve the same problems.</p>

<p>The ways JavaScript is used have evolved considerably since it was first introduced. Because of this, there are some libraries that are used <em>very</em> frequently to take care of things that almost every JavaScript program needs to handle. We will be starting with one that contains some basics that we'll need (and adding more later in the course).</p>

<section id="jquery">
<h2>jQuery</h2>


<aside class="lynda">Lynda.com course: <a class="lynda" href="https://www.lynda.com/jQuery-tutorials/jQuery-Essential-Training/183382-2.html" data-path="/jQuery-tutorials/jQuery-Essential-Training/183382-2.html">jQuery Essential Training</a>. <span class="help">[<a href="../lynda.html">Lynda.com help</a>]</span> This course introduces jQuery, covering many of the same topics. You can safely ignore anything titled &ldquo;AJAX&rdquo;, which we won't cover here.</aside>


<p><dfn id="jquery-dfn" data-term="jQuery">JQuery</dfn> is a very common JavaScript library (used on <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery">a majority</a> of the most-visited web sites). It makes several common tasks easier for the programmer: manipulating the HTML page, using events, animation.</p>

<p>We start by including the jQuery library, in the same way we include any other JavaScript code in the page: by using the <code class="html">&lt;script&gt;</code> element and indicating its URL.</p>

<blockquote id="code-script-jquery">
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src="http://cmpt165.csil.sfu.ca/js/jquery-3.2.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Including the jQuery library like this defines a function called <dfn id="jquery-func" data-term="jQuery function"><code class="js">jQuery</code></dfn> that will do lots of useful stuff, if we know how to use it.</p>

<p>Here is a complete page that uses the jQuery library:</p>
<blockquote id="code-jquery-first">
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
&lt;title&gt;First jQuery Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src="http://cmpt165.csil.sfu.ca/js/jquery-3.2.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery-event.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;First jQuery Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is paragraph one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paragraph 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>And the JavaScript file <code class="file">jquery-event.js</code> that goes with it:</p>
<blockquote id="code-jquery-event">
<pre class="brush: js">say_hello = function() {
  alert('Hello world!')
}
setup = function() {
  jQuery('p').click(say_hello)
}
jQuery(document).ready(setup)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>You can have a look at this <a href="../files/jquery-first.html">first page with jQuery</a> and see how it behaves.</p>

<p>There are lots of new concepts in this JavaScript file. It probably makes sense to take a look line-by-line.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="js">say_hello = function() { &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd><p>Just like before, this creates a function named <code class="js">say_hello</code>. Also like before, this function can be called with <code class="js">say_hello()</code> to run the code inside the <code class="js">{&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;}</code>.</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">alert('Hello world!')</code></dt>
<dd><p>This one line is the code that runs when the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function is called. As before, it pops up an alert window with the phrase &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo;.</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">setup = function() { &hellip; }</code></dt>
<dd><p>We are defining this function to do the work of setting up the JavaScript behaviour on the page (thus the name &ldquo;setup&rdquo;). It will be called after the browser loads the page (because we'll trigger that in the next lines of code).</p></dd>

<dt><code class="js">jQuery('p').click(say_hello)</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code class="js">jQuery</code> function is used to select some part(s) of the page. The function call <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> selects <em>every <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> element on the page</em>.</p>
<p id="click">Following with <code class="js dfn" data-term=".click()">.click(&hellip;)</code> sets the behaviour we want when those elements are clicked: in this case, we give it the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function. (We don't want to call the function right now, so we don't say <code class="js">say_hello()</code>. We just want to give jQuery the function <strong>it</strong> should call later, so we just give it the variable that holds it.)</p>
</dd>

<dt id="ready"><code class="js dfn" data-term=".ready()">jQuery(document).ready(setup);</code></dt>
<dd><p>This line gets everything started. The <code class="js">jQuery(document).ready(&hellip;)</code> idiom gives a function that should be called once the browser finishes loading the page (i.e. it is &ldquo;ready&rdquo;). In our case, we want the <code class="js">setup</code> function called when the page is ready, so we indicate it here.</p>
<p>This <code class="js">jQuery</code> is similar to the previous: it selects something (in this case the <code class="js dfn">document</code> special value, referring to the entire page), and connects some event (the document being ready, as opposed to being clicked as above) to a function.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<aside>The <code class="js">jQuery</code> function can also be called <dfn id="dollar"><code class="js">$</code></dfn>, so <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> and <code class="js">$('p')</code> are synonymous. We'll use <code class="js">jQuery</code> here, since it looks more like other function names.</aside>

<p>Notice that we didn't use the <code class="html">onclick</code> attribute in HTML here, but connected the logic to the HTML with jQuery. This puts all of the logic in the JavaScript file where it belongs, and leaves only content in the HTML. It also prevents repetition, since we can modify all of the pharagras at once, instead of having to say something for each <code class="html">&lt;p&gt;</code> on the page.
We will continue to do things this way, and you should as well.</p>

<p>Have another look at this <a href="../files/jquery-first.html">first page with jQuery</a>, and the <a href="../files/jquery-event.js">JavaScript code it uses</a>. Make sure you see how the behaviour unfolds: when the page is loaded, the <code class="js">setup</code> function is called to hook up the other events; it connects the <code class="js">say_hello</code> function to the click event on all of the paragraphs; when you click a paragraph <code class="js">say_hello</code> is called and does something you can actually see.</p>

<p>This might not be the most exciting behaviour you have ever seen on a web page, but we have <em>something</em> working. We will explore a few more things we can do with jQuery in the next section, <a href="js-jquerymore.html" class="xref">Working with jQuery</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="naming">
<h2>Naming jQuery Objects</h2>

<p>This jQuery code is actually equivalent to the above: you can take each part and put it in a variable if you want, but it's not always necessary.</p>

<blockquote id="code-jquery1">
<pre class="brush: js">setup = function() {
  all_paragraphs = jQuery('p')
  all_paragraphs.click(say_hello)
}
jquery_doc = jQuery(document)
jquery_doc.ready(setup)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The last two lines here were done in one line the the example above. This code takes the <code class="js">jQuery(document)</code> object and stores it in a variable <code class="js">jquery_doc</code>, and <em>then</em> uses the object's <code class="js">ready</code> function.</p>

<p>If you prefer this style, then you're welcome to store and name some all of your intermediate objects, but it becomes tedious. The point for now is that something like <code class="js">jQuery('p')</code> is just a JavaScript object: it can be stored in a variable, or can have its <code class="js">.click</code> function called, or both. There's nothing magical about the code <code class="js">jQuery('p')&ZeroWidthSpace;.click(say_hello)</code>: it's just doing a couple of things in one line.</p>
