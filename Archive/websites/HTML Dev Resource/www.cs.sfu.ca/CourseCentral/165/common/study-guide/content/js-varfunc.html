<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>In the previous example, we saw a function being defined like this:</p>

<blockquote id="code-varassign1">
<pre class="brush: js">say_hello = …</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This is actually much more general than just defining a function. What's actually happening in code this this is that <em>some</em> value is being stored in a variable.</p>

<p id="var">A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a way to store a value in our program. In this example, the variable is named <code class="js">say_hello</code>. The <code class="js">=</code> is used to <dfn>assign</dfn> to the variable: it takes the value on the right and stores it in the variable named on the left.</p>

<p id="varassign">This line of code is a <dfn>variable assignment statement</dfn>. When a variable assignment statement runs, the value is stored in the computer's memory and the variable name can be used to refer back to that value later.</p>

<p>Just like with <code class="html">class</code> and <code class="html">id</code> values in HTML, variable names should be descriptive and indicate what they are holding.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, any type of value can be stored in any variable, and there are many types the language supports&hellip;</p>

</section>

<section id="types">
<h2>Types</h2>

<p id="type">Like other programming languages, JavaScript can store and manipulate different <dfn>types</dfn> of values.</p>


<dl>
<dt id="numbers">Numbers</dt>
<dd>
<p><dfn data-term="numbers">Numbers</dfn> can be stored and calculated on in probably the obvious ways:</p>
<blockquote id="code-types1">
<pre class="brush: js">count = 7
pi = 3.1416
more = count + 1
twice_as_much = count * 2</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>After this code, we have created a variable <code class="js">more</code> currently holding 8 (one more than <code class="js">count</code> had when <code class="js">more</code> was assigned), and <code class="js">twice_as_much</code> holding 14.</p>
<p>As you can see, numbers can be both integers and real numbers with decimal parts.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="strings">Strings</dt>
<dd>
<p>In JavaScript, <dfn>strings</dfn> are sequences of characters. That is, they represent text. We have seen a string used (but not stored in a variable) in our very first piece of JavaScript code:</p>
<blockquote id="code-first-code">
<pre class="brush: js">alert('Hello world!')</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The words in the single-quotes are a string containing twelve characters.</p>
<p>We can also store strings in variables:</p>
<blockquote id="code-types2">
<pre class="brush: js">greeting = 'Hello'
name = "Becky B Barrington"
personal_greeting = greeting + ' ' + name</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, strings can be wrapped in either single or double quotes. When the <code class="js">+</code> is applied to strings, the strings are joined together.</p>
<p>The last line above joins three strings: the contents of <code class="js">greeting</code>, a string containing a space, and the contents of <code class="js">name</code>, The result is that the variable <code class="js">personal_greeting</code> contains the string <code class="js">'Hello Becky B Barrington'</code>.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Functions</dt>
<dd><p>As we have seen (and will explore more later), functions can be stored in variables.</p></dd>

<dt id="objects">Objects</dt>
<dd>
<p>An <dfn>object</dfn> is a value in JavaScript that can contain other things: numbers, strings, functions, other objects, etc. We haven't seen any objects in JavaScript yet: we will be using objects we get from other code, and will use them in a few simple ways.</p>
<p>We will explore objects further as we encounter them.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The type of information you're dealing with obviously affects what you can do with it. For example, this code makes sense if <code class="js">a</code> and <code class="js">b</code> are both numbers: it will subtract the two values.</p>

<blockquote id="code-types3">
<pre class="brush: js">result = a - b</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If <code class="js">a</code> and <code class="js">b</code> contain strings, then this code will cause an error. Similarly, this code made sense because the built-in thing called <code class="js">alert</code> is a function, so we can call it.</p>

<blockquote id="code-first-code-2">
<pre class="brush: js">alert('Hello world!')</pre>
</blockquote>


</section>

<section id="functions">
<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>

<p>Let's look again at the <code class="file">first-event.js</code> file:</p>

<blockquote id="code-first-event2">
<pre class="brush: js">say_hello = function() {
  alert('Hello world!')
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p id="func">This code creates a variable named <code class="js">say_hello</code>. This variable holds a <dfn>function</dfn>. Functions are used to is used to contain some logic: it could be a particular calculation, code you want to execute as the result of an event, or any other sensible collection of logic.</p>

<p>Our function definitions will look like this (with a few more parts to be added later):</p>

<blockquote id="code-function_template">
<pre class="brush: js">function_name = function() {
  …
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This creates a function called <code class="js">function_name</code>. When we <dfn id="call">call</dfn> that function (ask that it be executed), the logic in the <code class="js">{&hellip;}</code> will run line-by-line. [There is other syntax to define functions in JavaScript as well. We're going to ignore that.]</p>

<p>A function is called by using its name (or if you'd rather think of it this way: the name of the variable that is holding it), and parenthesis after it, like &ldquo;<code class="js">say_hello()</code>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In the HTML file above, we used a function call like this as the value for the <code class="html">onclick</code> property of the paragraph. When you click the paragraph, your web browser runs this JavaScript code, thus calling the function and running the logic in it.</p>

<p>Inside the function <code class="js">say_hello</code>, we call another function <code class="js">alert</code>. This function requires an <dfn id="arg">argument</dfn> which gives it more information about what it is supposed to do. The argument is put in the parenthesis and is the string <code class="js">'Hello world!'</code> in our example.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="../files/first-codepage.html">the example page with JavaScript</a> above. Click the paragraph: make sure you see what happens.</p>

</section>

<section id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the last few sections, we have seen many new concepts. This is sort of unavoidable: there are many pieces needed to make any program work. Here is a quick summary of what we have seen:</p>

<dl>
<dt id="summary-func">function</dt>
<dd>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a way to wrap up (and name) some behaviour in a program. We have used <code class="js">alert</code> and created a function <code class="js">say_hello</code>. Functions can be <dfn data-term="calling (a function)">called</dfn> by putting <code class="js">()</code> after their name, with <dfn>arguments</dfn> in the parenthesis if the function needs them.</dd>

<dt id="summary-event">event</dt>
<dd>An <dfn>event</dfn> is a way to refer to some specific things that happen in the web browser: the user clicks a particular element, the page finishes loading, the user types something in a form. We have seen (and will see more) ways to attach a function call to an event so we can make something happen as the result of the event.</dd>

<dt id="summary-variable">variable</dt>
<dd>A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a way to store some information in our program. and to give it a name so we can refer to it later.</dd>

<dt id="summary-type">types</dt>
<dd>Every value in JavaScript has a <dfn>type</dfn> (whether it's stored in a variable or just used as part of some calculation). The type determines what information it represents (number, string, function, &hellip;), and how we can use it (doing arithmetic on numbers, joining strings, calling functions, &hellip;).</dd>
